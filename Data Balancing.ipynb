    "# Dealing with Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, *imbalanced data* refers to training data where one class is vastly more common than the other. This can cause a problem, because we can create a learner that is very accurate (i.e., most of the predictions it makes are correct) because it simply always predicts the most common class, without really learning anything about the less common one. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the case with our Kaggle data, where we have several thousands of examples of the 0 case (hospital not in distress) versus a couple hundred example of the 1 case (hospital in distress). A learner can perform very well (looks like about 95% correct predictions) just by predicting 0 every time and ignoring the 1 cases. It will get those wrong, but overall it is a lower proportion of the score, so it doesnt matter for the accuracy. Our AUC measure combats this slighly, as it is based on balancing the false negative rate as well, but we can still learn a better model if we have more balanced data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is to artificially create a balanced dataset by \"oversampling\" the underrepresented class or by \"undersampling\" the very common class. This notebook will show two examples of doing this using scikit learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: You should always try to build a model with the original data distribution first, since this is the most accurate representation of how your testing data will look out in the wild.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we will be using a new library called Imbalanced Learn that has a bunch of different data preprocessing tools that may be useful. You can get Imbalanced Learn by activating your anaconda environment and running:\n",
